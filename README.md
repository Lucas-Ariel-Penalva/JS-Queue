# Javascript Queue Example

## A personal implementation of a Queue Data Structure in Javascript.

In programming, a **Queue** is a common data structure in which:

* Data can only be added to the end of the sequence (typically known as *tail* or back of the Queue).
* Data can only be removed from the beginning of the sequence (typically known as *head*, or front of the Queue).

### This implementation of the Queue class has the following methods:

##### 1. Show - Returns the Queue's data.

##### 2. Enqueue(element) - Takes a *Number* or a *String* and places it at the end of the Queue. Returns an error if *type* is incorrect.

##### 3. Dequeue - Removes an element from the beginning of the Queue and returns it.

##### 4. Front - Logs the element in front of the Queue and returns it.

##### 5. Size - Returns the Queue's length.

##### 6. isEmpty - Checks if the Queue is empty, returns a *Boolean*.
